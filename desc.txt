Remote repository  which is the content present on GITHUB

git remote add origin
we are giving remote respository a name which is "origin" to which our local reopsoitory is connected


TO delete a folder which is present in remote but not in local repository
git rm -r foldername
then push changes into remote repository

Cloning puropse is to get a folder from anothers git repo to our local repo
if we this folder into our remote repo we will face issues to overcome this we will 
follow
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin link


// we can use this but it will overwrite existing content in new repo
git push -u origin main --force

// if we want to fetch the latest changes form remote repository to local repository
git pull origin main
